# Lecture 09-1: INTRO TO OO IN C++

This is a folder containing the lecture materials for Monday, April
6th's on-line lecture.

It includes  
• PDF of my lecture slides `slides.pdf`   
• MIPS assembly source code in `samples` solving some exercises
• sample implementation of a `class Cmpx` in `samples/Cmpx`
I'll email you an invitation to the Zoom lecture which will be held at 3-4pm.

We look at the syntax for specifying and using C++ classes, that is,
we'll introduce the object-oriented features of C++. We do this by
inventing a complex number package (recall: complext numbers are
an extension of the real numbers that allow for taking the square
roots of negative numbers). This will mostly be a quick overview
by looking at an example in somewhat gory detail. We'll use
the next two coming lectures to go into the details more
carefully.

Here, we just dive right in.
